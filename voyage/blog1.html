        <h1 class="heading">Agra Beyond <span> Taj Mahal</span></h1>

        <p class="blogpage">Agra, a city that conjures images of the iconic Taj Mahal, is often seen as a one-stop destination for travelers.
             While the Taj Mahal is undoubtedly a masterpiece and a testament to undying love, there's much more to Agra than this magnificent monument. 
             Join us on a journey to explore the hidden treasures and lesser-known gems that make Agra a city of rich heritage and timeless stories.
             <br>

            <b>1. The Majestic Agra Fort:</b>
            Agra Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is an architectural marvel that often takes a back seat to the Taj Mahal.
            This imposing red sandstone fort, with its grand walls and intricate Mughal architecture, has its own fascinating history.
            While exploring the fort, you'll discover the halls where emperors once held court, the royal chambers, and splendid gardens that overlook the Yamuna River.
            <br>
            <b>2. Fatehpur Sikri - The Ghost City:</b>
            Just a short drive from Agra, you'll find Fatehpur Sikri, a deserted city that was once the Mughal Empire's capital. 
            Walking through this UNESCO-listed site feels like stepping back in time. Explore the grand Buland Darwaza (Gate of Victory), 
            the white marble Tomb of Salim Chishti, and the Panch Mahal, a five-story palace.
             Fatehpur Sikri's historical significance and architectural beauty are a must-see.
            <br>
            <b>3. Akbar's Tomb:</b>
            Hidden in a serene garden in Sikandra, Akbar's Tomb is the final resting place of one of India's greatest emperors, Akbar the Great. 
            The tomb's design is a harmonious blend of Indian, Islamic, and Persian architectural styles, featuring a stunning five-tiered pyramid.
            <br>
            <b>4. Mehtab Bagh - The Moonlight Garden:</b>
            For a different perspective of the Taj Mahal, visit Mehtab Bagh, also known as the Moonlight Garden. 
            Situated across the Yamuna River, this garden offers a unique view of the Taj Mahal,
            especially during sunset and moonlit nights. It's a quieter, less crowded spot to appreciate the beauty of the monument.
            <br>

            <b>5. Local Bazaars and Cuisine:</b>
            Agra's bustling bazaars are a paradise for shoppers. From the vibrant Kinari Bazaar to the bustling Sadar Bazaar, you can find an array of handicrafts, textiles, and jewelry. And don't forget to indulge in Agra's culinary delights. Savor local delicacies like petha (a sweet treat), paratha, and the Mughlai specialty, biryani, to get a taste of Agra's rich gastronomic heritage.
            <br>
            <b>6. Mughal Heritage Walks:</b>
            Explore the city's streets, bylanes, and historic neighborhoods on a Mughal Heritage Walk. These guided walks allow you to uncover hidden stories, cultural traditions, and the daily life of Agra's residents.
            <br>
            <b>7. Visit the Jama Masjid:</b>
            The Jama Masjid in Agra is a lesser-known architectural gem. It's an exquisite piece of Mughal architecture, and its serene ambiance offers a peaceful contrast to the bustling streets of the city.
            <br>
            In conclusion, Agra is not just a city of the Taj Mahal; it's a city of history, culture, and incredible beauty.
